Task Pro is a powerful web application built with React, Node.js, and MongoDB.
It is designed to help users manage their tasks. This README file provides an
overview of the application, its features, and instructions for setting up and
running the application locally.

Task Management: Users can create, edit, and delete tasks, assign them to
specific users, set due dates, and add additional details or comments.

User Management: Supports user registration and authentication, allowing users
to create their accounts, log in, and manage their tasks privately.
